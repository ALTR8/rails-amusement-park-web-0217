# Rails Amusement Park

## Objectives

Get comfortable with using form helpers, having models interact with each other, and building out a simple sessions system.

## Instructions
* Check out [The Demo](http://amusement-park.herokuapp.com/) to see where this lab is .
* This is a test driven lab, check out the model tests and get those to pass before moving onto the feature specs.
* Remember, if you use scaffolds or generators to not overwrite the model specs that are included in this lab. Always enter `n` or `no` when prompted to overwrite the model specs for this lab.
