# Rails Amusement Park

## Objectives

Get comfortable with using form helpers, having models interact with each other, and building out a simple sessions system.

## Instructions
* Check out [The Demo Site](http://amusement-park.herokuapp.com/) for an example.
* This is a test driven lab, check out the model tests and get those to pass before moving onto the feature specs.
