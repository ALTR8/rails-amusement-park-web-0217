# Rails Amusement Park

## Objectives

Get comfortable with using form helpers, having models interact with each other, and building out a simple sessions system.

You're going to be building an amusement park. There will be users, attractions, and users can take rides on attractions.

## Instructions

* Check out [The Demo](http://amusement-park.herokuapp.com/) to see where this lab is headed.
* This is a test driven lab, check out the model tests and get those to pass before moving onto the feature specs.
* Remember, if you use scaffolds or generators to <em>not</em> overwrite the model specs that are included in this lab. Always enter `n` or `no` when prompted to overwrite the model specs for this lab.
